# FontAwesome additional icons
##### This repository contains additional icons I made/converted for FontAwesome.
##### Feel free to contribute.
#
Originally created as addon for FontAwesome 5 with the help of:
* **[Gravit.io](http://designer.gravit.io)** designer
* **[Fontello](http://fontello.com/)** platform

## Note
I'll add more icons when I need them, but there's a chance, that I'll consider positively any requests.
Just open issue and provide neccessary information, such as:
```
* name
* source website
* SVG/AI file would be nice
* etc...
```
